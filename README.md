## üöÄ Getting started

1. Clone this repo
2. Import the desired accelerator into your preferred notebook (e.g., jupyter, Kaggle, Databricks Notebooks, Google Colab). We recommend using [DR-Notebooks](https://www.datarobot.com/platform/notebooks/).
3. Execute the notebook. 
4. Learn and understand the accelerator content. 
4. You should now be able to modify the accelerator to solve your own problem. The easiest place to start is to replace the input data with your own.
