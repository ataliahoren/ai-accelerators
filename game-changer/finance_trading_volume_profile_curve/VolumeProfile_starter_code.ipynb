    "# Build daily trading volume profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a template for using DataRobot time series models to build a daily trading volume profile. Each ticker in an exchange will have a different profile. In order to do so, you divide the trading day into intervals (starting at one minute, you can work with, for example, 5, 10 or 30 minutes intervals).\n",
    "For each of these intervals, and for each tickers, you want to know what fraction of the daily volume will be traded during that intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these intervals will have an Time Series models that predicts the fraction of volume that will be traded the next working day. While looking at historical data for the corresponding window, you will also leverage neighboring windows. That is, if you are predicting what will happen tomorrow between 9:35am and 9:36am, look at what has happened during that minute in the past, but also what happened between 9:30am and 9:35am and what happened between 9:36am and 9:41 (since you are looking at past days, you can look ahead to the following minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook (in conjunction with the helper file `helper.py`) provides the code necessary to prepare the data and run the modeling pipeline for each time window. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, to keep control of all the DataRobot projects required to build the volume profile, it creates a pandas dataframe that keeps track of the modeling choices, projects, and models that are used along the way."
