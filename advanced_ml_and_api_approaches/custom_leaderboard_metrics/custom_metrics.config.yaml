title: Model Selection via Custom Metrics
file_name: custom_metrics.ipynb
description: |-
  When it comes to evaluating machine learning model performance, DataRobot provides many of the standard metrics out-of-the box, either on the Leaderboard or as a model insight.
  However, depending on the industry, you may need to sort the Leaderboard by a specific metric that is not natively supported by DataRobot, or by return-on-investment (ROI).
  To help make this process easier, this notebook outlines a way to accomplish this leveraging DataRobot's Python client for a supervised, binary classification problem.
