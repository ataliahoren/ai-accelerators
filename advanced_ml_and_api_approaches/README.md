## Advanced Machine Learning and API Approaches
The DataRobot API's flexibility enables our data scientists, engineers and customers to build creative tools, quickly.  Notebooks in this repo are a grab-bag of topics that flex the use of the DataRobot API in different ways, and typically apply across install types and cloud providers. 

To incorpoarte into your workflow in your specific infrastructure, combine these with templates in the [ecosystem_integration_templates](https://github.com/datarobot-community/ai-accelerators/tree/main/ecosystem_integration_templates) folder. If something doesn't work or you have a suggestion, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/datarobot-community/ai-accelerators/issues)
