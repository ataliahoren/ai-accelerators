file_name: GCP_enrich_sentiment.ipynb
description: |-
  In this notebook, we demo the usage of the Google Cloud Natural Language API for sentiment analysis to enrich a customer churn dataset.
  The sentiment scores from the Google API helps improve the model performance in predicting the likelihood of churn for each customer, without requiring the user to train their own sentiment models.
