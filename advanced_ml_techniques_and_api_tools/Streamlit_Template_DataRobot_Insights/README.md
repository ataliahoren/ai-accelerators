# Churn prediction streamlit app

## Business problem

Churn prediction means detecting which customers are likely to leave a service or to cancel a subscription to a service. It is a critical prediction for many businesses because acquiring new clients often costs more than retaining existing ones. Once you can identify those customers that are at risk of cancelling, you should know exactly what marketing action to take for each individual customer to maximize the chances that the customer will remain.

A detailed use case description and solution approach can be found [here](https://pathfinder.datarobot.com/use-case/subscription-based-churn?tab=overview).
