title: Use feature engineering and Visual AI with high frequency da
file_name: high_frequency_data_classification_using_gramian_angular_fields.ipynb
description: |-
  This example notebook shows how to generate advanced features other than traditional aggregated features used for high frequency data use cases.
  The notebook uses Gramian Angular Fields to generate features from high frequency time series datasets like sensor readings.
  These GAF features can be used with DataRobot Visual AI.
  This approach of feature engineering can be used as an augmentation to other feature engineering techniques like spectrograms.
