file_name: effective_customer_communication_datarobot_gen_ai.ipynb
description: |-
  This notebook aims to provide an example of how generative AI models like GPT-3 can be used to augment predictions and provide customer friendly subject matter expert responses.
  The example chosen for this notebook shows how a generative AI model can provide positive user communication to adverse events like loan rejection that is predicted by the model.
  The generative AI model provides expert advice that is tailored for each individual loan applicant based on the prediction explanations provided by DataRobot.
