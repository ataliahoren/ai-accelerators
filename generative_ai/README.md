## Generative AI 

This section contains accelerators focused on integrating Generative AI with predictive AI to enhance business value and improve the data science workflow. These accelerators touch various parts of the modeling lifecycle (e.g. serving predictions, error analysis) and can be easily adapted through prompt engineering to suit your specific use case, and also serve as inspiration to creatively apply LLMs to your own problems.

To build and deploy your own custom AI/ML solutions in your specific infrastructure, you can combine these with templates in the [ecosystem_integration_templates](https://github.com/datarobot-community/ai-accelerators/main/update-structure/ecosystem_integration_templates) folder. If something doesn't work or you have a suggestion, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/datarobot-community/ai-accelerators/issues)  

## ðŸ’¥ What's in here?
| Title | Primary Label | What it's good for | Other Labels| Extensibility to other Integrations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Product Innovation GenAI](https://github.com/datarobot-community/ai-accelerators/tree/main/generative_ai/Product%20Innovation%20GenAI) | Retail | This accelerator demonstrates how you can use DataRobot and generative AI to identify key patterns in customer reviews and create reports or work items that can be used by product development teams to improve their products and offerings. Using various prompts you can steer the LLM into much more complex outputs like Agile stories, development plans, and more.| OpenAI, Langchain | Horizontal approach to extract insights from text data with LLMs/ DataRobot |
| [customer_communication_datarobot_gen_ai](https://github.com/datarobot-community/ai-accelerators/tree/main/generative_ai/customer_communication_datarobot_gen_ai) | Prediction Insights| Use Generative AI with DataRobot's prediction explanations to augment predictions and provide customer friendly and subject matter expert-level communication of the models outcome. | OpenAI| High, applies to any prediction that needs to be communicated to a non-technical audience  |
| [smart_cluster_naming](https://github.com/datarobot-community/ai-accelerators/tree/main/generative_ai/smart_cluster_naming) | Clustering | Template to use DataRobot Cluster Insights and ChatGPT to provide business- or domain-specific labels to the clusters using OpenAI and DataRobot APIs. As well, method to adapt prompting to tailor the cluster labels to suit the end users. | OpenAI, Unsupervised Modeling | High, applies to any clustering problem |
| [zero_shot_LMM_error_analysis_NLP](https://github.com/datarobot-community/ai-accelerators/tree/main/generative_ai/zero_shot_LMM_error_analysis_NLP)) | TNLP | Repeatable workflow and practical knowledge of using LLMs for zero-shot text classification and its application in performing error analysis of supervised text classification models | OpenAI | High, applies to any NLP problem |
