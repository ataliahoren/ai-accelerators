title: End to end modeling workflow with Azure
file_name: Azure_End_to_End.ipynb
description: |-
  This notebook illustrates an end-to-end data science workflow using DataRobot.
  The workflow ingests a dataset hosted in an Azure blob container, trains a series of models using DataRobot's AutoML capabilities, deploys a recommended model, and sets up a batch prediction job that writes predictions back to the original container.
