## Ecosystem Integration Templates
This section contains templates for connecting to data sources, building, deploying and monitoring models, and writing predictions back to data sources for common integration infrastructures. These templates are designed to be used as a starting point for building out your own solution pipelines and are solely focused on integration, not domain-specific applications. 

You can combine these with use-case focused accelerators in the [use_cases_and_horizontal_approaches](https://github.com/datarobot-community/ai-accelerators/tree/main/use_cases_and_horizontal_approaches) or [generative_ai](https://github.com/datarobot-community/ai-accelerators/tree/main/generative_ai) folders to build out your own custom AI/ML solutions or as a baseline for your projects. If something doesn't work or you have a suggestion, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/datarobot-community/ai-accelerators/issues)
